# Setting up a reverse proxy

1. You’ll first need to add a cname record, and point it at `revproxy.bloomvps.com```. 
2. Once you’ve done that, open a support ticket on our discord. Provide your hostname + domain name (ex: map.example.com), and the ip & port you want to proxy (ex: 192.168.0.1:8123). You can find your ip + port by opening the configuration dropdown menu, and selecting “Allocation Settings”. After you’ve provided the information, we will handle the rest.
